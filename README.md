# PDTW
This repository contians a time and space efficient Python implementation of [PDTW](https://github.com/SPEECHCOG/PDTW). Efficiency is increased by using modularity, fewer loops and calculations where unnecessary extra calculations were being done and a faster implementation for calculating cosine distance using vector normalization, amongst other improvements.

PDTW is a an unsupervised speech segmentation algorithm to detect word boundaries for low resource languages.
